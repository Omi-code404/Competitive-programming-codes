## Problem: 1030A - In Search of an Easy Problem

Problem Statement:  
You need to check if any person in a group thinks the problem is hard (marked as 1).
If everyone thinks it's easy (all `0`s), output EASY, otherwise output HARD.

*Approach*:  
1. Simple Check:  
   - Read the number of people n.  
   - Read their responses.  
   - If any response is 1, immediately conclude it's HARD.  
   - If all are 0, output EASY.  
2. Time Complexity: O(n) (since we check each input once).  
3. Space Complexity: O(1) (no extra space needed beyond input storage).

### Solution Code
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n, response;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &response);
        if (response == 1) {
            printf("HARD\n");
            return 0;  // Early exit if any '1' is found
        }
    }
    
    printf("EASY\n");
    return 0;
}
